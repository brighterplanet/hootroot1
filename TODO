* hoptoad (api key env var)
* remove activerecord if it's not used
* move session secret to env var
* update to rails 3.0.5
* add a directions item for flying . . . "123 mile flight . . . 10 kg CO2 [methodology link]"
* proposal: if a mode tab is clicked but it's *already* selected, it should toggle the directions display
* use distance rather than duration for amtrak
